# Minimum Nomination Bond

The minimum amount you need bonded in order to nominate.

# Commission

Validators can take a percentage of the rewards they earn. This chunk is called their commission.

Nominating validators with low commissions mean you will receive a larger share of the rewards they generate.

Many validators will have a commission rate of 100%, meaning you will receive no rewards by nominating these validators.

Examples of such validators include those operating on behalf of exchanges, where nominating and reward distribution is done centrally on the exchange in question.

A validator can update their commission rates as and when they please, and such changes will have an impact on your profitability. Be sure to monitor your nominations on this dashboard to keep updated on their commission rates.

# Over Subscribed

Only the top 256 nominators for each validator are rewarded in Polkadot. When this number is surpassed, this validator is considered over subscribed.

# Blocked Nominations 

When a validator has blocked nominations, nominators are unable to nominate them.
