# Stash and Controller Accounts

The Stash and Controller are simply Polkadot accounts that manage your staking activity.

Your Stash account is the account used to hold your staked funds, whereas the Controller account is used to carry out Staking actions on the Stash account\'s behalf.

When you switch accounts in this app, you are actually switching your Stash account. Your Controller account is then automatically fetched for you.

This app assumes you have both Stash and Controller accounts imported. If you do not, you will not be able to use all app functions.

You can assign a different Controller account on the Stake page.

# Bonding

Bonding funds is the process of "locking" (or staking) DOT. Bonded DOT will then be automatically allocated to one or more of your nominated validators.

# Nominating

Nominating is the process of selecting validators you wish to stake your DOT to. You can choose to nominate up to 16 validators for each of your accounts.

Once you have nominated your selected validators, they become your nominations.

# Nominations

Your nominations are the validators you have chosen to nominate. You can nominate up to 16 validators.

Your bonded funds are automatically distributed to nominations that are active in the staking era.

As long as at least one of your nominations is actively validating in a session, your funds will be staked with that validator and you will receive rewards
