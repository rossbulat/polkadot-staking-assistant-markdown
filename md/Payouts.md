# Payout History

Historical records of payouts made for your nominations.

Requesting payouts is a manual process, so you may receive payouts for multiple eras in quick succession or in a sporadic fashion. Your payout graphs may therefore have multiple payouts occur on the same day, or have days where there were no payouts.

This does not mean that you were not nominating or generating rewards in that period - only that the payout for that period was not yet made.
