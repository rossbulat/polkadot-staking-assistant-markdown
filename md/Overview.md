# Epoch

An epoch is another name for a session in Polkadot. A different set of validators are selected to validate blocks at the beginning of every epoch.

1 epoch is currently 4 hours in Polkadot.

# Era

At the end of each era, validators are rewarded DOT based on how many era points they accumulated in that era. This DOT reward is then distributed amongst the nominators of the validator via a payout.

1 era is currently 24 hours in Polkadot.

# Era Points

Era Points are accumulated by validators during each era, and depend on a validator\'s performance.

As a staker, you do not need to worry about Era Points. In general, better performing validators produce more Era Points, which in-turn lead to higher staking rewards.

# Payout 

Payouts are staking rewards on Polkadot. They depend on how many "Era Points" your nominated validators accrue over time. Rewards are determined at the end of every Era (24 hour periods).

To receive staking rewards, a Payout needs to be requested. Any nominator backing the validator in question can request a Payout.

One payout request triggers the reward payout for every nominator.
